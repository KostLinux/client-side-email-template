# ClientSide Email Integration

This is a simple client side emailing form built with EmailJS. It is a simple form that allows users to send emails directly from the client side without the need for a server. The email form also uses Google reCAPTCHA to prevent spam.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to sign up for an account with EmailJS and Google reCAPTCHA. You will also need to create a new email template in EmailJS and add your email address to the template. You will also need to add your Google reCAPTCHA site key to the form.

1. Sign up for an account with EmailJS at [https://www.emailjs.com/](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Create a new email template in EmailJS and add your email address to the template
3. Sign up for an account with Google reCAPTCHA at [https://www.google.com/recaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha)
4. Fill the gaps in index.js and index.html
5. Open browser, open developer console, fill the form and submit it. Don't submit it twice, sometimes it needs some time
6. In console you'll see the message "Mail sent!", if you see it, it means that the email was sent successfully
